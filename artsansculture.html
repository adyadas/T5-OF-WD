Traditionally done on walls and paper using natural colors, Madhubani art is famous for its vibrant patterns and depictions of mythological themes, nature, and daily life.

The cultural landscape of Bihar is enriched by its diverse folk traditions. **Bhojpuri, Maithili, and Magahi** music and dance are integral to local festivities, with lively beats and soulful lyrics reflecting everyday struggles, love, and devotion. Festivals like **Chhath Puja, Sonepur Mela, and Rajgir Mahotsav** showcase Bihar’s deep cultural roots, bringing together music, dance, and religious fervor. The state is also home to ancient architectural marvels, including Buddhist stupas, Mauryan pillars, and Mughal-era mosques, each narrating a chapter of Bihar’s glorious past.  

Theatrical performances and folk dramas like **Bidesia**, popularized by Bhikhari Thakur, play a significant role in Bihar’s artistic expression, highlighting social issues through music and storytelling. Handicrafts such as **Sikki grass products, terracotta pottery, and Sujani embroidery** further exemplify the artistic talent of Bihari artisans.
